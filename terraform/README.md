# PkgEvalFarm infrastructure

Terraform/OpenTofu configuration for the PkgEvalFarm backend: a distributed
PkgEval job farm consisting of a job queue (SQS), run/job state tables
(DynamoDB), a results bucket (S3), and a small "broker" Lambda that hands out
temporary AWS credentials to authorized GitHub users.

## Architecture

- **`<prefix>-runs` / `<prefix>-jobs` (DynamoDB)** — one item per PkgEval run,
  and one item per (run, package) job.
- **`<prefix>-jobs` (SQS)** — queue that workers poll for jobs; messages that
  fail to be processed 4 times land in `<prefix>-jobs-dlq`.
- **Results bucket (S3)** — workers upload logs/artifacts and submitters
  publish reports under `runs/<run_id>/...`. Objects under `runs/` expire
  after 180 days. If `public_reports` is true (the default),
  `runs/*/report/*` and `runs/*/logs/*` are publicly readable.
- **`<prefix>-broker` (Lambda)** — exposed via a public Lambda function URL.
  It performs the GitHub OAuth *device flow*, checks the user's team
  membership in `github_org`, and vends temporary credentials by assuming the
  `<prefix>-worker` or `<prefix>-submitter` IAM role (scoped to exactly the
  queue/tables/bucket operations each side needs).

## Enrollment and authorization

There is no per-machine registration and no long-lived secrets:

- Authorization is entirely driven by **GitHub team membership**. Members of
  the `worker_team` team in `github_org` may enroll worker machines; members
  of `submitter_team` may submit runs.
- **Adding a worker operator = adding them to the GitHub team.** Removing them
  from the team revokes access as soon as their current temporary credentials
  (default 1 hour, see `cred_duration_seconds`) expire.
- When a worker (or submitter) starts, it runs the GitHub device flow against
  the OAuth app identified by `github_client_id`, sends the resulting user
  token to the broker, and receives short-lived AWS credentials plus the
  queue/table/bucket configuration.
- **The broker function URL is the only thing workers need to be given** —
  all other configuration (queue URL, table names, bucket, region) is served
  by the broker itself.

## Variables

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `name_prefix` | no | `"pkgeval"` | Prefix for naming all resources. |
| `region` | no | `"us-east-1"` | AWS region to deploy into. |
| `bucket_name` | **yes** | — | S3 bucket for PkgEval results. |
| `github_org` | **yes** | — | GitHub organization whose teams gate access. |
| `worker_team` | no | `"pkgeval-workers"` | Team slug allowed to run workers. |
| `submitter_team` | no | `"pkgeval-submitters"` | Team slug allowed to submit runs. |
| `github_client_id` | **yes** | — | Client ID of the public GitHub OAuth app used for the device flow. |
| `cred_duration_seconds` | no | `3600` | Lifetime of the temporary credentials the broker vends. |
| `public_reports` | no | `true` | Make `runs/*/report/*` and `runs/*/logs/*` publicly readable. |

## Deploying

1. **Build the broker Lambda zip first.** The Lambda resource packages
   `broker/build/bootstrap.zip`, which is not checked in; from the repository
   root run:

   ```sh
   julia --project=broker broker/build/build.jl
   ```

   (`tofu validate` works without the zip, but `plan`/`apply` require it.)

2. Deploy:

   ```sh
   cd terraform
   tofu init
   tofu apply -var bucket_name=<bucket> -var github_org=<org> -var github_client_id=<client-id>
   ```

3. Note the `broker_function_url` output and hand it to worker operators and
   submitters — that URL is all they need.

Re-run steps 1–2 whenever the broker code changes; the `source_code_hash`
picks up the new zip automatically.
